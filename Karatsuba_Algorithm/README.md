## The Challenge
In this exercise, we are going to multiply two 64-digit numbers.

The numbers are below:

```
3141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592
```
```
2718281828459045235360287471352662497757247093699959574966967627
```

Calculating the output by hand is very tedious. The numbers are too huge to fit in the ranges of ```int```, ```long```, ```long long int``` or even ```double```.
